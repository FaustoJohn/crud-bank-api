# User Authorization Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added validation to the `getUser` endpoint (`GET /v{version}/users/{id}`) to ensure users can only fetch their own details. Any attempt to access another user's details now returns a 403 Forbidden response.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated UsersController.cs

#### Added Required Using Statement
- Added `using System.Security.Claims;` to access JWT claims functionality

#### Enhanced GetUser Endpoint Documentation
- Updated XML documentation to reflect the new authorization behavior
- Added description noting that users can only retrieve their own details
- Added 403 Forbidden response documentation

#### Added Authorization Logic
```csharp
// Check if the authenticated user is trying to access their own details
var currentUserId = GetCurrentUserId();
if (currentUserId == null)
{
    return Unauthorized();
}

if (currentUserId.Value != id)
{
    return Forbid("You can only access your own user details.");
}
```

#### Added Helper Method
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Gets the current authenticated user's ID from JWT claims
/// </summary>
/// <returns>The authenticated user's ID, or null if not found</returns>
private int? GetCurrentUserId()
{
    var userIdClaim = User.FindFirst(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier)?.Value;
    return int.TryParse(userIdClaim, out var userId) ? userId : null;
}
```

#### Updated Response Attributes
- Added `[ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status403Forbidden)]` to the endpoint

## Security Benefits

### ✅ Enhanced Security
- **User Privacy**: Users can no longer access other users' sensitive information
- **Data Protection**: Bank account details, balances, and personal information are now properly protected
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only have access to their own data

### ✅ Proper Error Handling
- **401 Unauthorized**: Returned when the JWT token is invalid or missing
- **403 Forbidden**: Returned when a valid user tries to access another user's data
- **404 Not Found**: Returned when the requested user ID doesn't exist

### ✅ Consistent with Banking Security Standards
- **Account Isolation**: Each user can only access their own account information
- **Authorization Controls**: Proper separation between authentication and authorization
- **Audit Trail**: Clear error messages for security violations

## API Behavior Changes

### Before Implementation
- Any authenticated user could fetch any other user's details
- No authorization checks beyond basic authentication
- Potential privacy and security violations

### After Implementation
- Users can only access their own details
- Attempting to access another user's details returns 403 Forbidden
- Maintains proper authentication and authorization separation

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Valid Access**: User requests their own details ✅ 200 OK
2. **Invalid Access**: User requests another user's details ❌ 403 Forbidden
3. **Unauthenticated Access**: No token provided ❌ 401 Unauthorized
4. **Invalid Token**: Malformed or expired token ❌ 401 Unauthorized

### Test File Created
- `test-user-authorization.http`: Contains comprehensive test scenarios for validating the authorization logic

## OpenAPI Documentation Updates

### Enhanced Swagger Documentation
- Updated endpoint description to clearly state authorization requirements
- Added 403 Forbidden response with proper documentation
- Maintains comprehensive API documentation accuracy

### Response Codes
- **200 OK**: User details retrieved successfully
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication required or token invalid
- **403 Forbidden**: User attempting to access another user's details
- **404 Not Found**: Requested user ID does not exist

## Implementation Notes

### JWT Claims Usage
- Leverages existing JWT token structure with `ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier`
- Reuses the same pattern established in `AuthController.GetCurrentUserId()`
- Maintains consistency across the codebase

### Error Messages
- Clear, user-friendly error message: "You can only access your own user details."
- Follows REST API best practices for error responses
- Provides sufficient information without exposing system internals

### Backward Compatibility
- No breaking changes to the API contract
- Existing clients will receive 403 responses for unauthorized access
- Maintains all existing endpoint functionality for authorized users

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Admin Role**: Could add admin users who can access all user details
2. **Audit Logging**: Log authorization failures for security monitoring
3. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting for failed authorization attempts
4. **Role-Based Access**: Implement more granular role-based permissions

### Configuration Options
- Authorization rules could be made configurable
- Different access levels could be implemented based on user roles
- Admin override capabilities could be added
